  "summary": "Back in July 2010, the owners of the Marblehead, MA based medical billing company dumped these records and a Boston Globe photographer noticed them while dumping his own trash out. There ended up being 67,000 individual records that included names, addresses, Social Security numbers and pathology reports for treatments such as cancer. How Goldthwait Associates handled the records was a breach of both federal HIPAA safeguard requirements and state laws that require organizations to dispose of or de-identify PHI. They will have to shell out $140,000 as part of the settlement.",
